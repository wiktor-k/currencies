#+TITLE: Currencies

This is a sample application utilizing both =actix_web= and =awc=.

The application retrieves rates of several currencies and outputs a
JSON document.

This later is being consumed by the Lametric Time device:

[[./docs/lametric.jpg]]

* Running

=cargo run= will start the application listening on localhost's port 8080.

=curl localhost:8080= will trigger the only action available: rendering of [[https://lametric.com/][LaMetric]] frames.

* Building

The application can be build for both AMD64 and AArch64/ARM64 architectures using [[https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/][Docker BuildKit]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker buildx build --push --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t wiktork/currencies:8 .
#+END_SRC
